# IICARus

This repo is a web application used to provide training and reviewing services to the public for learning publications appraisal. 

This web application is written for supporting project "IICARus", A randomised controlled trial of an Intervention to Improve Compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines. This project is aimed to assess whether mandating the completion of an ARRIVE checklist improves full compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines. Manuscripts, limited to in vivo studies, will be scored by two independent reviewers against the operationalised ARRIVE checklist, blinded both to intervention status and to the scores from the other reviewer. Discrepancies will be resolved by a third reviewer who will be blinded to the identity, and unblinded to the scores, of the previous reviewers. Discrepancies will be resolved by a third reviewer who will be blinded to the identity, and unblinded to the scores, of the previous reviewers.

The deployed version of the web application of IICARus project can be found at https://ecrf1.clinicaltrials.ed.ac.uk/iicarus/

The web application was written by me with the collaboration of the whole CAMARADES(www.camarades.info) group.
